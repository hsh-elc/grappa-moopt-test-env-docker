# grappa-moopt-test-env-docker

Quickly set up Docker Test Environment for Grappa and MooPT.

Grappa and MooPT will be installed and connected on first run automatically.

!!! Currently you still have to pull or build docker images locally within `docker-daemon` container (see [Connect to Dockerd](#connect-to-dockerd) below).

# Still to do...
- [ ] preinstall grader images in `docker-daemon` (see [Connect to Dockerd](#connect-to-dockerd) below).
- [ ] alternatively preinstall public images in `dind` via `docker-compose`. Something like:
	```
	service:
	  docker:
		command: >
		  ash -c "docker pull ghcr.io/hsh-elc/grappa-backendplugin-graflap:latest
		  && docker pull ghcr.io/hsh-elc/grappa-backend-dummygrader:latest
		  "
	```
- [ ] list requirements: docker and docker-compose versions
- [ ] MooPTs input fields are currently not parsed from ProformA
- [ ] MooPTs default prefs not working properly for Moodles general settings (`moopt/defaults.php`)
- [x] update `grappa-config.yaml` to 2.2.0



# Getting started 

First run of `docker-compose up` will take a while to config `bitnami-moodle`.
This will create volume-folder below `volumes/` as well.
Do this attached, so you can see, when itâ€™s done ;)
```
docker-compose up
```
Afterwards just start environment by:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Check for running by
```
docker-compose ps
```

For logs of specific container just use set container name. Eg:
```
docker logs moodle-moopt
```
(If you would like to follow this log add option `-f`.)

When youâ€™re done at first shutdown with
```
docker-compose down
```

## Access Moodle
Moodle will connect to MariaDB and bootstrap everything. 
Take a coffee until Moodle logs something like "`** Moodle setup finished! **`" (few minutes on first run).

Since all these services are in the `grappa-network` they can communicate to each other but are not exposed outside this network.
The only container with exposed ports is `moodle-moopt`.
This is available on port `8088`.
So on host-machine browse to `http://localhost:8088` to access Moodle.
In general: `<IP of docker host mashine>:8088`

If it runs on a remote server only with `ssh` permission, tunnel traffic to your localhost by running:
```
ssh -N -L 11235:localhost:8088 <user>@<remote-host>
```
Now access locally by `http://localhost:11235`.

Login with user and password set in `docker-compose.yaml`:
```
user=test
pw=test
```
(These must fit the values in `grappa-config.yaml`)


## Permission Issues for Volumes
On Ubuntu it may occurs that there are permission denies for writing files in volumes.
In this case shut down all containers and renew volume folders with script:
```
cd volumes/
sudo ./clear_folders.sh
```
(Note to run this script with `sudo` _and_ within `volumes/`.)

This will remove the whole directory recursively and create new ones with root permissions.

If this not helps for MariaDB, try following command, to allow access explicitly to user `1001` (set up in Baseimage).
```
sudo chown -R 1001 volumes/mariadb_data
```
For me it runs with the following perms:
- MariaDB: `1001/root` (user/group)
- Moodle: `daemon/root` (user/group)

## Volumes Issue
In trouble on setup make sure mounted folder are completely empty 
(not even a contained `.gitkeep` is allowed ðŸ™„. 
These folders need to be _empty_).
Use `clear_folders.sh` from `volumes/` for quick cleanup.


# Grappa Config
Grappa config is copied from `grappa/grappa-config.yaml` into container at build time.
Edit this file and rebuild container to apply changes:
```
docker-compose stop grappa-tomcat && docker-compose up -d --build grappa-tomcat
```

Webservice `.war`-file is copied from `grappa/grappa-webservice-2.war` into container at build time.
Place updated `.war` here an rebuild container as above.
Note: Filename must fit within `Dockerfile` also.

Tomcat logs are redirected to `sysout` by Bitnami.
Access them by using docker logs:
```
docker logs grappa-tomcat
```

Connect to running grappa-container:
```
docker exec -it grappa-tomcat /bin/bash
```

# MooPT Config
To make default settings for MooPT (or Moodle in general), edit file `moopt/defaults.php`.
Find the help in the [Moodle Documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Administration_via_command_line#Custom_site_defaults).
Apply setting by rebuilding container:
```
docker-compose stop moodle-moopt && docker-compose up -d --build moodle-moopt
```
(Since bitnami build the `config-for-grappa.php` at first run, altering this file a priori will have no effect.)

# Connect to Dockerd
Since `dind` is build upon an Alpine attach to container with:
```
docker exec -it docker-daemon /bin/ash
```
(Note to use `ash` instead of `bash`.)

## Pull Images
Currently you'll have to pull them manually:
1. Attach to `docker-daemon`:
	```
	docker exec -it docker-daemon /bin/ash
	```
2. (Optional for private packages) Login with your username and read-only [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to access private packages.
	Note to choose only "read packages" when creating the PAT since nothing more is needed.
	```
	export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN
	echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
	```
	(see https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)
3. Pull desired image, e.g.:
	```
	docker pull ghcr.io/hsh-elc/grappa-backendplugin-graflap:latest
	```

# Used images
- Independent Docker-Daemon: [`docker:dind`](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker)
- Bitnami Redis: [`bitnami/redis`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis/)
- Bitnami Tomcat as Baseimage for `grappa-tomcat`: [`bitnami/tomcat`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/tomcat/)
- Bitnami MariaDB for Moodle: [`bitnami/mariadb`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mariadb/)
- Bitnami Moodle as Baseimage for `moodle-moopt`: [`bitnami/moodle:3`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/moodle)


# Further Ideas:
- make a volume for `host_jvm_bp`s mounting local `.jar` installations into the container
